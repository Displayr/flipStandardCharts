\title{Generates a vector of colors for the number of rows in the passed-in
df or matrix chart.matrix; where colors can be either a single named
color or a hex color, any code that generates a vector of named colors
or a vector of hex colors (but not a mixed vector), or a single named
color palette from either of the packages grDevices, RColorBrewer,
colorspace, or colorRamps.  If a single color is provided, and more are
needed, then a gradient will be calculated towards white. If more than
one but fewer than needed are provided, a gradient will be calculated
between the provided colors.}
\usage{
ChartColors(chart.matrix = NULL, given.colors = qColors, reverse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{chart.matrix}{Any item with a positive non-zero integer returned by
the function nrow.}

\item{given.colors}{Character; a vector containing one or more named
colors from grDevices OR one or more specified hex value colors OR a single
named palette from grDevices, RColorBrewer, colorspace, or colorRamps.}

\item{reverse}{Logical; if the output color vector shour be reversed.}
